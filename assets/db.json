Yes, it still has all the hits — the kung pao pastrami, the thrice cooked bacon —but chef/proprietor Danny Bowien and executive chef Angela Dimayuga have also added a raw bar, two generous family-style set menus, and showstoppers like duck baked in clay. And you can still get a lot of food without breaking the bank."

The banchan plates are uniformly good, and Deuki Hong’s menu also includes winning dishes like stir-fried squid noodles, kimchi stew, and seafood pancakes. If it’s available, make sure to order the kimchi and rice “lunchbox.” Baekjeong is a great place for large groups and birthday parties."

Every inch of the massive Lower East Side space smells intensely of pastrami and rye loaves. The sandwiches are massive, so they are best when shared. Order at the counter, and don't forget to tip your slicer — your sandwich will be better for it."

Straightforward classics like smoked brisket and baby back ribs are always a strong choice, but there are also options like pork belly tacos and a lamb belly banh mi. The space is sprawling in a way that feels like the real deal, and Durney himself can usually be found working the room, and keeping a watchful eye on the smoking meats. It's counter service only, and there's often a line, but for the scene and certainly for the meat, it's easily worth the trip to Red Hook."

Headley and his crew turn seasonal vegetables into delectable salads and riffs on American comfort food favorites. The specials menu changes daily, and the rest of the menu is constantly evolving. You can get a lot of food to eat here for under $15 per person."

The Dutch is now an indelible part of the Soho landscape."
